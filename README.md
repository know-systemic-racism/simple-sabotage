# simple-sabotage

The working title of the project is based on the [Simple Sabotage Field Manual](https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:cx492jc0657/Simple-sabotage-fieldmanual.pdf) from the US government office of strategic services, 1994, which is primarily concerned with "innumerable simple acts which the ordinary individual citizen-saboteur can perform." The inaccessibility of California Law Enforcement Policies that have been posted publicly may be the result of any number of reasons. Most importantly, the law SB978 does not require that the materials be machine readable. Nonetheless, there are cases where the materials have been made so difficult to find and read that we guessed there may be simple sabotage at work. 

The goal of this project is to compile examples of the hurdles to getting access to the documents and to provide recommendations for how and why to provide guidelines for posting policies that are more accessible in accordance with FAIR standards.
